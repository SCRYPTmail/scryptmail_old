		<h3>Data Collection</h3>
	</div>

	<div class="row sMailTextAlignLeft">
		SCRYPTmail user data collection is limited to the following:<br><br>
		<ul>
			<li>Account activity involving sending or receiving email to/from third party server -
				Due to limitations of the SMTP protocol, we have access to the following email metadata: sender and recipient email addresses, the IP address incoming messages originated from, message subject, body and attachments and message sent and received times. <br><br></li>

			<li>Account activity involving sending or receiving email within SCRYPTmail servers - Sent times. Due to exclusive way SCRYPTmail operates, all other metadata is encrypted and not accessible to the server to read. Retrieving recipient public keys and sending emails is two different API calls. To establish connection, it would be required to store detailed API call information and run complex data analysis. This action can be performed but only through a court order or a subpoena. Please refer to our canary warrant for more information.<br><br></li>

			<li>SCRYPTmail using access log to store the following records to improve service and optimize server efficiency -
				Last login time, IP address, User agent, API call.
				All API call data is encrypted whenever it’s possible and not recorded anywhere in our system.<br><br></li>

			<li>We have no ability to match an IP to a specific user account.<br><br></li>

			<li>Communicating with SCRYPTmail - Your communications with SCRYPTmail, such as sales and support requests, bug reports or feature requests are retained and may be saved by our staff.<br><br></li>


			<li>During beta stage, we also collect de-bugging information from our PHP server and JavaScript code. This data is sent to us only if script caused error and contains only information about user agent, script name and line caused error. No personal information is collected.</li>
		</ul>

Furthermore, inventory data can be stored for up to two years if the handling of a complaint and other reasons require this action for an orderly settlement of the contract. Moreover, the deletion of inventory and billing data may be omitted provided that legal regulations or the prosecution of claims require this action. Order-related data and the addresses associated with the order are stored in respect to tax, contract and commercial law retention periods and erased at the conclusion of those periods.
